# bop
## Introduction
Bop is a super fun esoteric programming language in which code is "written" by pressing inputs according to predetermined rhythms.
## Design Principles
- Keyboards are large, unwieldy, and wholly unnecessary for programming in Bop; A single key should suffice.
- Theoretically, by decreasing the time interval, programs in Bop can be created from scratch in a matter of seconds.
- It should be fun to program in Bop!
## Language Concepts
Programs in Bop are created by first running the corresponding Python script, which opens a window in which your inputs will be entered. Accepted inputs are as follows:
- Spacebar
That's it.
By pressing Spacebar repeatedly at various time intervals, commands are issued and interpreted into generic programming commands:
