# bop
## Introduction
Bop is a super fun esoteric programming language in which code is "written" by pressing inputs according to predetermined rhythms.
## Design Principles
- Keyboards are large, unwieldy, and wholly unnecessary for programming in Bop; A single key should suffice.
- Theoretically, by decreasing the time interval, programs in Bop can be created from scratch in a matter of seconds.
- It should be fun to program in Bop!
## Language Concepts
Bop is a stack-based programming language, as everything revolves around a central stack that is initiallly empty. Programs in Bop are created by first running the corresponding Python script, which opens a window in which your inputs will be entered. Accepted inputs are as follows:
- `Spacebar`

That's it.
By pressing Spacebar repeatedly at various time intervals, commands are issued and interpreted into generic stack-based programming commands like `push`, `pop`, `add`, as well as control flow commands like `while`. Specific commands and how to issue them are detailed in the next section.
## Syntax Elements
Commands are issued by pressing a sequence of intermitten spaces and pauses, which will be represented as `Space` and `Pause` respectively below.
By default, the time interval between commands is 1 second. For example, the command `Space` `Pause` `Space` could be issued by pressing Space on second 1, pausing on second 2, and pressing Space again on second 3.
